# Markdown Previewer and Editor

#### This is an interactive webpage where users can markdown code and have it instantly displayed. The text area is pre-populated with examples of what everything looks like, and the syntax with which to write it. This was originally a project from the [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/) website, and their examples are included here in the MDexample folder. 

## Prerequisites 

### Node.js- Node Package Manager is installed and updated
### React.js - downloaded and properly installed from NPM
### Markdown - a basic knowledge of markdown is helpful, but not completely necessary.

#### This app was created using NPM and React. 

### Since this page was made as a project, I would like to thank FreeCodeCamp.org for their comprehensive Front End Libraries projects.
